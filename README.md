# ChetuPamoja: Crypto Donations for Kenyan Organizations

## The Problem

Local organizations in Kenya are missing out on a massive opportunity: the country's growing crypto market. Despite over 4.6 million crypto users in Kenya, most organizations cannot accept crypto donations. This leads to:

- Donors facing high international transfer fees (10-15%)
- Crypto holders unable to contribute to causes they care about
- Missed opportunities for anonymous or transparent giving

**The gap:** Organizations are unable to access a large, untapped donor base of crypto users.

## Our Solution

ChetuPamoja is a simple, secure crypto donation platform designed for Kenyan organizations. It works alongside existing channels like MPESA, making it easy for organizations to accept crypto without technical barriers.

### What We Provide
- **Plug-and-play donation infrastructure**: Easy integration for organizations
- **QR code donations**: No signups required for donors
- **Real-time blockchain tracking**: Transparent and verifiable donations
- **Global reach**: Accept donations from anywhere, without banking barriers

**Result:** Organizations can access new donor segments, while crypto holders get meaningful ways to use their digital assets for social good.
